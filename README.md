Code Explanation

-Our server.js file sets up the Express server, specifying our port number, the npm packages that need to be loaded, and also the routes, which we have externalized

-There are 2 separate HTML files (home.html and survey.html) that serve as the front-end portion of our code; they determine what the user sees (the homepage and the survey, which will also show the resulting best match)

-Our 2 routing files (htmlRoutes.js and apiRoutes.js) determine the back-end logic (based on the request being made, the response that gets sent to the browser); the HTML routes display the survey and the homepage based on the URL that is accessed, and the API routes send back existing content in our server-side data or add new friends

-Best match is calculated by finding the friend with the minimal difference in scores and then sending that friend to the browser as a JSON object

-A modal is then toggled, displaying the the best match to the person who just took the survey

-In essense, this will also be a form of notes that you may later reference weeks later
